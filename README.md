# This is a in/out payment system I made when I was a kid, it was written in Clipper 5.2 and shouldn't be take seriously (none of my code should actually).
# I decided to upload it in here just for historical purposes, or to give people a reason for a good laugh.
# Code is basically as it was back then, I haven't touched it since mid 90's.
